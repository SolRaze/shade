// MARK: - Host Audio Latency

/// What the Mac's output device adds after its mixer, which the sound plugin
/// adds to the speaker's output latency so a guest player holds its picture
/// back by as much as the sound is late. vphone-vm reads it from CoreAudio
/// and sends it after every connect and whenever the Mac's output changes.
///
/// It is stored as `VPhoneVirtIOSoundHostLatency` in `com.apple.coreaudio`
/// for user mobile, the domain the plugin reads its settings from in
/// audiomxd, and `com.vphone.audio.host-latency` is posted so a running
/// audiomxd reads it again. Each answer is `{seconds}`, plus `changed` after
/// a set; an unchanged value is neither written nor posted.
///
/// See Research/Guest/virtio_sound.md §6 (Picture against sound).
