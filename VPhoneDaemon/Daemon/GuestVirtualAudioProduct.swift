/// Stores the ProductID VirtualAudio should route this guest with.
///
/// VirtualAudio reads `ProductIDOverride` in `com.apple.audio.virtualaudio`
/// before it derives a ProductID of its own, and the one it derives on a VM
/// never initializes: no sound anywhere. The sound plugin sets the key inside
/// audiomxd on every launch, which works as long as the plugin initializes
/// before VirtualAudio reads its defaults; audiomxd's sandbox keeps that write
/// from reaching disk. Nothing guarantees the order. A stored value needs
/// none, so vphoned stores the same one here, at startup: every launch of
/// audiomxd after this finds it whichever plugin comes first.
///
/// A value already stored gives way. The earlier recipe had 198 set by hand,
/// and a guest that kept it dropped every tone. Someone who wants another ID
/// sets `VPhoneVirtIOSoundProductID` in the plugin's settings instead, which
/// the plugin reads too; 0 there leaves VirtualAudio's key alone.
///
/// Only on a guest that has the plugin: the ID selects a speaker route, and
/// without the plugin there is no device for it.
///
