# Installing vphone

Read `status` first (`vphone-launchpad-cli status`) and skip every step it
already shows as done. Steps 1 and 2 happen once per Mac, by the Mac's owner.

## Host requirements

- Apple Silicon, macOS 15 or newer. It does not run inside another VM, because
  the guests need nested-free paravirtualization.
- The entitled `vphone-vm` must be admitted by AMFI. The owner chooses one of
  two host configurations in macOS Recovery (SIP off with
  `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1`, or SIP on `--without debug` plus an allowlist),
  and both need `csrutil allow-research-guests enable`. The details are in
  `Documents/Guides/host-setup.md` of the repository.
- Launchpad's Host Setup page checks these, the network (`updates.cdn-apple.com`,
  `api.github.com`), Developer Tools access and the root helper. When the
  allowlist is the only thing missing, Launchpad applies it for you through its
  helper, per bundle signature.

Do not change SIP, boot-args or nvram yourself. They need a reboot into
Recovery and are the owner's call. Say which check failed and stop.

## Launchpad

1. Open <https://github.com/Lakr233/vphone-cli/releases>.
2. Download `vphone-launchpad-<version>-notarized.zip`. Use the plain
   `vphone-launchpad-<version>.zip` only when the release has no notarized one;
   macOS blocks it the first time, and the user must open System Settings >
   Privacy & Security and click **Open Anyway**.
3. Unzip and move the app to `/Applications`. Launchpad does not update itself:
   to update, download the new version and replace the app.
4. Open it once. On first launch the user completes Host Setup: allow
   Developer Tools access, and install the helper (it asks for an administrator
   password). Developer Tools access takes effect after Launchpad is relaunched.
   `canInstallBundles` in `status` turns `true` when both are done.

Which versions are notarized is listed in `Documents/Downloads/README.md`.

## The CLI on PATH

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -sf /Applications/vphone-launchpad.app/Contents/MacOS/vphone-launchpad-cli ~/.local/bin/
vphone-launchpad-cli help
```

Do not use `sudo` for this; `~/.local/bin` must be on PATH, and calling the CLI by its full path works the same. The CLI starts Launchpad in the
background if it is not running and waits for the control socket
(`~/Library/Application Support/vphone-launchpad/control.sock`, mode 0600,
same user only). Nothing listens on the network; reach it over ssh from another
machine.

## VPhone.bundle and series matching

Launchpad and the bundle must share a **series**: the first two numbers of the
version. Launchpad 2.2.3 works with any 2.2.x bundle, and the reverse. Patch
releases inside a series stay interchangeable, so take the newest in the series.
Launchpad refuses a bundle that is too old, but it may still list bundles from a
newer series; do not install those, update Launchpad first.

```sh
vphone-launchpad-cli bundle install-release 2.2.3           # an explicit X.Y.z of Launchpad's series
vphone-launchpad-cli bundle list
vphone-launchpad-cli bundle use 2.2.3                    # switch the active one
vphone-launchpad-cli bundle verify 2.2.3                 # re-check
```

`install-release` downloads the release from GitHub, verifies it, installs it
into the root-owned store through the helper, makes it active, and runs host
preflight. `bundle list` shows per version: `active`, `accepted`, `policy`,
`preflight`, `preflightDetail`, `cdhashes`, `path`.

Always pass an explicit version. `latest` means the newest release by publish
date, prereleases included, and it is installed and made active at once, so it
can land in a newer series than Launchpad. Read Launchpad's version with
`/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print CFBundleShortVersionString' /Applications/vphone-launchpad.app/Contents/Info.plist`
(`status` does not report it), then pick the newest non-prerelease `X.Y.z` of the
same `X.Y` from `gh release list -R Lakr233/vphone-cli` or the releases page.

`bundle accept <version>` uses a version although its checks failed and
`--off` takes that back. `bundle remove <version>` deletes one. Neither is for
routine use; ask first.

The first step that needs the helper after its five-minute authorization
expires asks the user for an administrator password on the Mac. Warn them
before running one, and do not retry in a loop while a prompt is open.

## Testing a local build

From a source checkout:

```sh
xcodebuild -workspace VPhone.xcworkspace -scheme VPhone \
  -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' \
  -derivedDataPath .build/XcodeBundle build

vphone-launchpad-cli bundle install-local .build/XcodeBundle/Build/Products/Debug/VPhone.bundle
```

`install-local` takes a folder or a `.zip`, installs it as `<version>-local`,
makes it active, adds the execution policy exception, allows the new
`vphone-vm` cdhash and runs preflight. Relative paths are resolved by the CLI.
Every rebuild changes the cdhash, so run `install-local` again (or
`bundle verify <version>-local`) after each build. Compare against the release
it replaces with `bundle use <version>`.

## When an install step fails

Match the symptom in [install-faq](install-faq.md) before trying anything:
"damaged and can't be opened", Developer Tools access switching itself off
(`tccutil reset DeveloperTool com.vphone.launchpad`), several macOS
installations, `zsh: killed`, and the rest.

## Checking the result

`vphone-launchpad-cli status` should show `hostReady: true`, `helper` as
`ready (…)`, `bundleReady: true` and an `activeBundle`. Then continue with
[machines](machines.md).
