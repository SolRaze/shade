// CustomFirmwareVirtualAudio.swift — keep `No default VAD present` from
// terminating audiomxd.
//
// VirtualAudio walks the current port list applying speaker protection and the
// DSP chain whenever a property write arrives that touches the route (most
// visibly MediaExperience's VAD serialization listener, which pushes saved
// route and volume state on every launch and on every route change). The
// walker needs a `vdef` virtual audio device to apply anything to; when the
// speaker port is published by a device that is not one of VirtualAudio's own
// — the virtio sound device publishing as `PuffinOutput`, whose `pspk` speaker
// port is what makes playback routable in a vphone guest at all — the list it
// is handed can hold no `vdef`, and the walker answers that with
// `throw std::runtime_error("No default VAD present")`.
//
// The throw sits inside an AudioServerPlugIn property callback, which is a C
// boundary that cannot propagate C++ exceptions: the exception reaches
// `std::terminate` and audiomxd aborts. The saved serialization state then
// replays the same write into every later launch, so one abort becomes a
// crash loop until the guest is rebooted.
//
// The walker holds five exception sites — "No default VAD present", two
// "Could not construct" (each behind a routing-mutex assertion), "Unexpected
// HAL speaker protection ... *VP* speaker protection", and a generic
// "Precondition failure." — every one unreachable on real hardware, where the
// built-in speaker is a codec the routing layer grew up with. A guest whose
// speaker arrives any other way reaches them all.
//
// The patch rewrites the first instruction of each throw block — the `mov w0,
// #<size>` that sizes the exception allocation — into a branch to the
// function's own epilogue, so each condition degrades to "apply nothing and
// return". The diagnostic logs that precede the throws are left intact.
//
// Anchoring
// ---------
// Nothing is a literal address. The site is found from the C string
// `No default VAD present`, which the code references exactly twice: once as
// the os_log format's argument (x3) and once as the `runtime_error`
// constructor's message argument (x1), the second reference being the throw
// site. Both references must resolve, and the ctor reference must be the one
// whose `add` is followed by a call. The throw block is then read backwards
// from there: `bl` (the exception allocation) preceded by `movz w0, #imm`.
// The epilogue is found forwards from the `___cxa_throw` call as the stack-
// guard-checked pop sequence ending in `retab`, and its shape is verified
// instruction by instruction before the branch is encoded.
//
// The mute-set throw
// ------------------
// Establishing the route also asks the HAL device itself to unmute:
// Device_HAL_Common's set wrapper pushes `kAudioDevicePropertyMute` through
// `AudioObjectSetPropertyData` and reads it back. iOS's HAL server rejects a
// device-level mute on a plugin device with 'what' without ever forwarding
// the selector to the driver — ASDAudioDevice's dispatch has no case for it
// — and the wrapper answers any failed set by throwing a CAException out of
// the callback. RoutingManager catches it and abandons the route, which
// leaves the vdef's aggregate on Null_Device and the guest silent. Every
// caller of the wrapper ignores its return value, so skipping the throw is
// safe: the FAIL and EXCEPTION diagnostics still log, and the route proceeds
// as if the mute had held.
//
// Anchored on the mute-set log ("Set mute value of %u on HAL device"), whose
// single `__text` reference sits in the wrapper's selector dispatch. Within
// the wrapper, the site is the CAException throw block — the exception
// allocation, the status stored into the object, the throw call — that has
// the "Unable to set property data." EXCEPTION log a few instructions above
// it; iOS 27's wrapper holds a second, unrelated CAException (the
// deactivated-device throw), and that log window is what tells them apart.
// The epilogue is the wrapper's single `retab`, walked back to its entry.
//
// The speaker-protection gate
// ---------------------------
// With the walker and the mute-set throw quieted, a route change still
// declines at the last step: RoutingHandler_Playback_GenericConfig1 builds
// the whole route — virtual stream, DSP chain, format match — and then
// rejects it because the route's device list calls for HAL Speaker
// Protection, a capability only a physical codec reports. The capability
// query never leaves VirtualAudio, so no plugin can provide it. The decline
// is a log line and a branch to the handler's failure path, which leaves the
// vdef's output stream on Null_Device: every "playing" signature is genuine
// and nothing is audible, volume included.
//
// Anchored on the decline's log format, a message three routing handlers
// share — ours is the handler whose log block also names
// RoutingHandler_Playback_GenericConfig1.cpp. The gate's branch is left as
// it is; what changes is the log block it jumps to, whose opening
// instruction — the `mov w0, #<size>` sizing the os_log — becomes a branch
// back to the gate's own fall-through. A taken gate now lands on the
// success path the handler already built, which never reads the verdict
// the gate tested, on either supported build. The block is entered only by
// the gate's jump — the instruction above its head is an unconditional
// branch, checked before anything is written — so no fall-through is
// orphaned, and leaving the gate's branch intact is what lets the anchor
// find the site again on an already-patched binary.
//
// RoutingHandler_PlaybackAndRecord_GenericConfig1 holds the same gate in the
// same shape, and a route that plays and records ('cpar', what a recording
// app asks for) is declined by it once the guest has a microphone port to
// build that route with. It is the patch's second site, found by that
// handler's own file name. Its volume-mode test is a plain branch between
// two ways of building the route, not a precondition, and needs nothing.
//
// The volume-mode precondition
// ----------------------------
// The gate opened; the route survives its own construction and dies one
// step later on a precondition. The handler asks the volume-mode lookup for
// the route's default scope and requires a packed (present,
// kHardwareOnlyReadOnly) pair back; a device whose software volume runs any
// other mode — the virtio plugin's reports SoftwareHardwareMix — fails the
// test, and the handler answers a `std::logic_error` that unwinds into
// RoutingManager, which fails the route and tears the session down onto
// Null_Device. Same silence as the gate produced, one layer later: by then
// the route had already built its DSP chain, its virtual stream and an
// IOProc on the virtio aggregate.
//
// The precondition's own text survives only in the iOS 27 build
// ("softwareVolumeModeForPerDefaultScope.has_value() && … ==
// kHardwareOnlyReadOnly"); iPadOS 26 stripped it to a bare "Precondition
// failure.". What identifies the site on both builds is the test itself:
// the handler masks the lookup's return with the 33-bit packing mask
// (`and xN, xM, #0x1ffffffff` — a present flag in bit 32 above the mode's
// low 32 bits), compares it against the expected pair, and branches to the
// decline on inequality. Two sibling preconditions in the same handler
// branch off plain flag tests, so the mask is what tells the declines
// apart. The write is the one the speaker-protection gate performs: the
// comparison stays intact, and the decline's log block head becomes a
// branch back to the comparison's fall-through, which reloads everything
// it reads from memory and never re-reads the value the test examined, on
// either supported build.
