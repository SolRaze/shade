// CustomFirmwareVirtualAudioGraphConfigurations.swift — speaker chains to the
// generic graph path in graph_configurations.plist.
//
// VirtualAudio builds each route's DSP chain through a factory that switches
// on the chain's `chainType`. Every `speaker_*` configuration ships with
// `clhs` — the HAL SpeakerProtection chain, whose construction looks a
// physical "Speaker" device up in the device registry and throws
// `Could not lock weak ptr` when the registry has none. A VM has no speaker
// hardware, so with the route walk otherwise fixed, the chain factory is what
// still kills every speaker route: RoutingManager catches the throw, logs
// "Failed to activate a route list", and the guest stays silent.
//
// The `dflt` chainType takes the generic graph chain instead — the same path
// every `beam_mic_*` and `omni_mic_*` configuration already uses. It needs no
// device: it loads the configuration's `graph` DSP file, which the tuning set
// ships for every speaker configuration. Flipping the speaker entries to
// `dflt` moves speaker routes onto that path; the tuning files themselves are
// not touched.
//
// The plist lives at `/Library/Audio/Tunings/<acoustic ID>/VAD/` on the
// sealed system volume, so the change rides the offline install; the patcher
// itself only ever sees a staged copy.
