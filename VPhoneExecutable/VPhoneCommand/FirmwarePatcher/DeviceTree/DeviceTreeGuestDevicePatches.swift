// DeviceTreeGuestDevicePatches.swift — The iPad presentation of the vphone600 tree.
//
// vphone600ap is a virtual iPhone: `artwork-device-idiom` is "phone", the root
// `model` is iPhone99,11, and most `/product` properties are `syscfg/xxxx`
// placeholders (flag 0x8000) that no syscfg on a VM ever fills. An iPadOS
// userland reads the same nodes, so a guest restored from an iPad IPSW lays
// itself out as a phone unless the tree it boots says otherwise.
//
// The answers come from the iPad's own device tree, `DeviceTree.<board>.im4p`,
// which the IPSW carries and the restore tree keeps:
//
//   - the `/product` properties in `copiedProductProperties` take the board's
//     values, and are removed where the board has none — so an iPad mini keeps
//     `disable-chamois` and an M-series iPad, which has Stage Manager, does not;
//   - the phone-only placeholders no iPad carries (Dynamic Island,
//     reachability, ringer switch, volume-button geometry, CarPlay, Watch
//     pairing) are removed, which is what "absent" means to MobileGestalt;
//   - the root and `/product` identity becomes the board's, with VPHONE600AP
//     kept second in `compatible` so the platform expert still binds.
//
// What stays vphone600: everything that describes the virtual hardware —
// `graphics-featureset-class` (the paravirtual GPU is APPLE7, not the iPad's),
// `framebuffer-identifier`, `has-virtualization`, the guest agent port, memory
// class and boot flags.
//
// Only the installed tree carries these. Restore boots `RestoreDeviceTree`,
// which keeps the iPhone99,11 identity `restored_external` checks against the
// manifest; see `FirmwareManifest.separateGuestDeviceTree`.
//
// One edit here is every guest's, not only an iPad's: `/product/haptics` goes
// from every tree of every role, because no VM has the actuator or the haptic
// server the node promises. See `removeHaptics(from:)`.
