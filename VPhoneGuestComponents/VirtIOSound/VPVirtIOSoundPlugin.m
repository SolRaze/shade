// VPVirtIOSoundPlugin.m — CoreAudio HAL plugin for the VM's virtio-snd device.
//
// audiomxd loads this bundle from /System/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL when the
// kernel has published `AppleVirtIOSound` (Info.plist's loading condition).
// Each `AppleVirtIOSound` service becomes two HAL devices, a speaker with the
// service's output streams and a microphone with its input streams, because
// VirtualAudio builds a port from a device's UID and one UID names one kind
// of port. The host opens its microphone only while the guest records: the
// virtio input stream is started when CoreAudio starts the microphone device
// and released when it stops.
//
// Each device clock (VPVirtIOSoundClock.h) is free running, anchored to
// mach_absolute_time when I/O starts, as the macOS plugin's is. The mixed
// output goes into a ring (see VPVirtIOSoundRing.h) and a timer hands it to
// the kernel a period at a time with the async write selector; the virtio
// device paces playback on the host.
// Input runs the other way without a timer: a few periods of the input ring
// are always with the kernel, and each one that comes back full is replaced.
//
// Optional settings in the `com.apple.coreaudio` preference domain, read
// once when audiomxd loads the plugin:
