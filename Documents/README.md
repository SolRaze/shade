Start with the [Launchpad quick start](../README.md#get-started). For terminal use, see [Create and Run](Guides/create-and-run.md). Version 2.x applies the complete firmware patch set; there are no selectable patch variants.

## For Contributors

- `vphone-launchpad`: A Mac app that downloads and installs `VPhone.bundle` and sets up the host. Released separately.
- `vphone-cli`: Prepares firmware, patches it, restores the system, and manages VMs.
- `vphone-vm`: Runs the VM and shows its window.
- `vphoned`: The control service inside the VM. The window's features and the API work through it.

- `xcodebuild -workspace VPhone.xcworkspace -scheme VPhone build` produces and validates `VPhone.bundle`. Run each project's test scheme separately.
- The [research index](../Research/README.md) groups patch and implementation records by subject.
- The [patch inventory](../Research/0_binary_patch_comparison.md) compares patches per component.
