# Downloads

Each [release](https://github.com/Lakr233/vphone-cli/releases) has up to three files:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `vphone-launchpad-<version>-notarized.zip` | Launchpad, signed and notarized by Apple. Download this one when it is available. |
| `vphone-launchpad-<version>.zip` | Launchpad, not notarized. macOS blocks it the first time you open it. |
| `VPhone-<version>.zip` | `VPhone.bundle`. Launchpad downloads and installs it for you, so you do not need this file. |

## Notarized Launchpad Versions

| Series | Notarized | Not Notarized |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.2 | 2.2.0, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.5 | 2.2.1 |
| 2.1 | 2.1.0, 2.1.1, 2.1.2 | 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.1.5, 2.1.6, 2.1.7 |
| 2.0 | 2.0.4, 2.0.5, 2.0.6, 2.0.8, 2.0.9 | — |

There is no 2.0.7 release.

To open a version that is not notarized, open it once, then go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.

## Matching Launchpad and VPhone.bundle

Use a `VPhone.bundle` from the same series as Launchpad. The series is the first two numbers of the version: Launchpad 2.2.3 belongs to 2.2 and works with any `VPhone.bundle` 2.2.x.

| Launchpad | VPhone.bundle |
| --- | --- |
| 2.2.x | 2.2.x |
| 2.1.x | 2.1.x |
| 2.0.x | 2.0.x |

Within a series, install the newest `VPhone.bundle`. Patch releases fix problems without changing how Launchpad and the bundle work together.

Launchpad refuses a `VPhone.bundle` that is too old for it, but it may still list bundles from a newer series. Do not install those; update Launchpad to that series first. Launchpad does not update itself: download the new version from the release page and replace the old app.

VMs created by 1.x do not start in 2.x. For 1.x, see the [1.0.14 release](https://github.com/Lakr233/vphone-cli/releases/tag/1.0.14).
