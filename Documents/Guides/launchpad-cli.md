# Launchpad command line

`vphone-launchpad-cli` ships in `vphone-launchpad.app/Contents/MacOS`. It
drives the running Launchpad over a Unix socket at
`~/Library/Application Support/vphone-launchpad/control.sock` (mode 0600,
served only to the same user) and starts Launchpad in the background when it
is not running. It has no privileges and no state of its own: bundles are
installed through Launchpad's helper, each machine runs through the
`vphone-cli` of its own Core Bundle, and every command appears in Launchpad's
window and command history. Nothing listens on the network; reach it over ssh
from another machine.

Progress lines go to stderr as they arrive. The result is one JSON document on
stdout. The exit status is 0 on success and 1 on failure, with the reason on
stderr. Interrupting the CLI cancels a command that can be cancelled
(`exec`, waits, CFW install); a bundle install or machine creation belongs to
the window and keeps running.

```sh
ln -s /Applications/vphone-launchpad.app/Contents/MacOS/vphone-launchpad-cli /usr/local/bin/
vphone-launchpad-cli help
```

## Core Bundle per machine

Every machine is bound to one installed `VPhone.bundle` version, chosen when
it is created and kept in `launchpad.json` in the machine folder. Installing a
bundle never changes a machine's binding. A machine is made of three layers,
each from a bundle at a different time:

| Layer | What | Comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host Programs | `vphone-cli`, `vphone-vm` | The bound bundle, on every command. A new binding applies at the next start. |
| Guest Environment | vphoned and the hook dylibs | `cfw install` at creation, and `cfw update-environment` (stopped machine) later. |
| Boot Chain | Patched firmware, restore, CFW patches | `fw patch`, `restore` and `cfw install` at creation. Fixed; only a new machine changes it. |

The **default** bundle (formerly "active") decides only the version
`vm create` binds when `--bundle` is not given, and what `exec` and
library-wide commands run with. A new install becomes the default unless
`--keep-default` is passed. The first start of a machine in a Launchpad
session checks its bundle (execution policy exception, AMFI, host preflight)
once.

Local builds install as `<version>-local.<hash>`, the hash taken from the
bundle's code-signature seal, so two builds of one version sit side by side.
Older stores may still hold `<version>-local` or `<version>-ci.<commit>`.

## Testing a VPhone.bundle build

```sh
xcodebuild -workspace VPhone.xcworkspace -scheme VPhone \
  -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' \
  -derivedDataPath .build/XcodeBundle build

# Installs as <version>-local.<hash>, makes it the default, adds the execution
# policy exception, allows the new vphone-vm cdhash and runs host preflight.
vphone-launchpad-cli bundle install-local .build/XcodeBundle/Build/Products/Debug/VPhone.bundle

# Move an existing machine to it; --update-environment also redeploys the
# new vphoned and hook dylibs (the machine must be stopped).
vphone-launchpad-cli vm set-bundle research-01 2.4.0-local.1a2b3c4d --update-environment

vphone-launchpad-cli vm start research-01 --wait
vphone-launchpad-cli guest rpc research-01 device.info
vphone-launchpad-cli guest rpc research-01 apps.list '{}'
vphone-launchpad-cli vm log research-01 --lines 100
vphone-launchpad-cli vm stop research-01
```

The exact version is in the install result and in `bundle list`. The first
step that needs the helper after its five-minute authorization expires asks
for an administrator password on the Mac, as the window does.

## Comparing two builds

Install both without moving the default, then give each its own machine:

```sh
vphone-launchpad-cli bundle install-local /path/to/A/VPhone.bundle --keep-default
vphone-launchpad-cli bundle install-local /path/to/B/VPhone.bundle --keep-default
vphone-launchpad-cli bundle list        # note both versions

vphone-launchpad-cli vm create cmp-a --bundle 2.4.0-local.aaaaaaaa
vphone-launchpad-cli vm create cmp-b --bundle 2.4.0-local.bbbbbbbb
```

Machines created this way differ in all three layers. To compare only host
programs and guest environment on one boot chain, clone a machine in the
window and rebind the copy:

```sh
vphone-launchpad-cli vm set-bundle cmp-b 2.4.0-local.bbbbbbbb --update-environment
```

`vm list` shows which bundle each layer came from. `bundle remove` refuses a
version while a machine is bound to it; rebind or delete those machines first.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | Host checks, helper, default bundle, machine counts |
| `bundle list` | Installed versions, receipts, cdhashes, check results, bound machines |
| `bundle install-local <path> [--keep-default]` | Install a local `VPhone.bundle` folder or `.zip` |
| `bundle install-release <version\|latest> [--keep-default]` | Download and install a GitHub release |
| `bundle set-default <version>` / `bundle verify <version>` | Make a version the default, or re-check it. `bundle use` is the old name of `set-default` |
| `bundle accept <version> [--off]` / `bundle remove <version>` | Skip failed checks, or remove a version no machine is bound to |
| `vm list` | Machines in every library with run state, Core Bundle and log path |
| `vm start <name> [--headless] [--wait]` / `vm stop <name>` | Launch with the machine's bundle, or stop; `--wait` waits for vphoned |
| `vm wait <name>` / `vm log <name> [--kind create\|dfu\|patch]` | Wait for vphoned; read a console log |
| `vm create <name> [--bundle <version>] [...] [--device <product-type>] [--from <step>]` | The New Machine pipeline, bound to `--bundle` or the default; `--device` makes an iPad guest, `--from` retries from a step |
| `vm set-bundle <name> <version> [--update-environment]` | Bind a machine to another installed version. `--update-environment` also redeploys that version's guest environment and needs a stopped machine |
| `vm leases [--release]` | DHCP leases on the shared NAT network and the machine that owns each. `--release` frees the ones no machine in any library uses, through the helper (see [Networking](networking.md#addresses-held-by-old-macs)) |
| `cfw install <name>` | Install CFW into a stopped machine with its own bundle, through the helper |
| `cfw update-environment <name>` | Redeploy the machine's own bundle's guest resources (vphoned, hook dylibs) into it while stopped, through the helper; nothing else changes |
| `guest send <name> <json>` | One raw `vphone.sock` request (tap, swipe, key, screenshot) |
| `guest rpc <name> <method> [params]` | Any vphoned method, see `Research/vphoned_http_api.md` |
| `guest unlock <name> [--passcode <code>] [--timeout <seconds>]` | Turn the screen on and unlock the guest, whatever state it was in (vphoned `screen.unlock`). `--passcode` is needed only when the guest has one |
| `exec [--bundle <version>] <vphone-cli arguments>` | Run the default bundle's `vphone-cli`, or that version's, streaming its output. `--bundle` must come first |

Machine commands take `--root <library>` when two libraries hold a machine
with the same name. `guest` commands and `--wait` go through the machine's
`vphone.sock`, which every launch serves; bundles up to 2.0.9 serve it only
for machines launched with a window.

## Bundle fields in results

| Command | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `defaultBundle` | The default version. `activeBundle` holds the same value for older scripts |
| `bundle list` | `default` | This version is the default. `active` holds the same value for older scripts |
| `bundle list` | `machines` | Names of the machines bound to this version |
| `vm list` | `bundle` | The version the machine's host programs run with |
| `vm list` | `guestEnvironmentBundle` | The version whose guest environment was installed last; `null` while unknown |
| `vm list` | `bootChainBundle` | The version that built the boot chain; `null` for a machine created before Launchpad recorded it |
| `vm create`, `cfw …`, `exec` | `bundle` | The version the command ran with |

When `guestEnvironmentBundle` differs from `bundle`, host and guest come from
different builds; `cfw update-environment` brings the guest in line.
